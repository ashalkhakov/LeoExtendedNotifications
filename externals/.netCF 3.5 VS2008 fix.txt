SenseSDK is a .netCF 3.5 assembly!!!!
It will not work in 2.0...

For designtime... 

1)

The metadata assembly (StedySoft.SenseSDK.PocketPC.asmmeta.dll) MUST be added to the "designer metadata" directory. 

For CF 3.5, this directory would be the following...

C:\Program Files\Microsoft.NET\SDK\CompactFramework\v3.5\Wind owsCE\DesignerMetadata

This should allow the dependency to the StedySoft.SenseSDK.PocketPC.asmmeta.dll assembly to be found.


2)

Create a new tab in VS2008 toolbox... then right click and add the SDK (browse to the StedySoft.SenseSDK.dll)

If the controls do not show in VS2008 toolbox, try:

cmd /c start /wait devenv /setup /resetuserdata /selfreg /resetskippkgs

from the command prompt to reser all user settings.

NOTE: Sometimes I added the controls with a form open with SenseSDK controls on it... it failed, but after deleteing the tab and recreating without the form open it worked.
